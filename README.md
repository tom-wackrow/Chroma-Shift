## 📖 About the Game

ChromaShift is a puzzle-platformer where players can only see obstacles in a single color at a time—Red, Green, or Blue. Players must strategically navigate the environment by switching colors at specific Color Change Stations, which always set their vision to a preset color.

### 🎮 Gameplay Features
- Color-Limited Vision – Players can only see one color at a time, affecting how they perceive the level.
- Color Change Stations – Pre-set points that force players into a specific color, creating strategic navigation challenges.
- Multi-Layered Level Design – Obstacles can be composed of multiple colors (e.g., cyan walls are visible in both green and blue modes).
- Puzzle-Solving & Platforming – Navigate shifting environments, unlock doors, and avoid hazards by thinking in layers.

### 🚀 How to Play
- Move with WASD / Arrow Keys
- Interact with color change stations to switch vision
- Navigate obstacles by swapping between Red, Green, and Blue modes
